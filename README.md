# Subscription-Usage-Analysis-of-Friend-feed-social-network


This project was created using RapidMiner tool.

Here the friend feed data of months August to September 2010 has been considered. This social network is no longer active, it behaved as an feed aggregator.
More information on friend feed can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendFeed.


This project has used the association data mining technique to find the pattern of subscriptions of users. 
This pattern can latter be used to send out subscription suggestions to user with similar patterns.


To get the frequent item sets the FP growth operator has been used which in turn runs the FP growth algorithm on the binomial data.
